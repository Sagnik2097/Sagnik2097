In this Power BI project, I've focused on analyzing personal finances. The project is designed to help me identify where I'm allocating most of my expenses, where opportunities for saving exist, and whether I'm consistently meeting my monthly or yearly savings goals. I can also track my net worth on a yearly basis and pinpoint the specific months or years when I've exceeded my spending limits.

One essential aspect of the project is to calculate the ratio between my earnings and expenditures. This ratio will give me a clear understanding of my financial health and whether I'm living within my means. Moreover, I can determine the precise amount of money I need to save each month in order to achieve my target savings by the time I retire.

The project also includes visually appealing tooltips that enhance the overall dashboard's attractiveness and usability. These tooltips provide additional information and insights when I hover over different elements of the dashboard, making the data interpretation more intuitive and insightful.
